HNA Post AP Coding Challenges 2019
=========
Good work pledge
-----
We are here to broaden your exposure to Computer Science. We can only achieve that purpose when you work hard and honestly. It may be tempting to copy-paste code from a classmate, or let a classmate do all your work for you don't! You will be cheating yourself from the most valuable thing course has to offer overcoming challenges.

We know that hard, and honest work doesn't come easily. If you feel like you are falling behind

1. Don't copy-paste code, or let someone do your work for you
2. Ask for help!
3. Tell the teaching-team you need more time 

Getting started
-----
1. Go to the provided assignment link, and click accept. It should take you to your project page. (If it doesn't, click on the link above again, and click on the link to the project page).
2. On the GitHub project page, click on the green "Clone or Download" button and copy the link.
3. Open Intellij, click on the "Checkout from Version Control" drop down and select "GitHub"
4. On the next page paste the link you copied into the "Git Repository URL" box.
5. Click Clone. You may have to enter your GitHub username and password.
6. If it asks you whether you want to open the project or not, select yes.
7. You should see your project open. If you need to reopen the project, you should see it under "File > Open Recent"
8.  You should see 'ScoreCalculator Configuration' in a dropdown and a play button next to it. Hit the play button to run your program.

The Project
-----
In this GitHub package you will find 6 coding challenges. Each challenge will have you implement one method. As you complete each coding challenge you should run the `ScoreCalculator` class. This will run all of the tests and tell you your updated score! For each challenge it will tell you how many tests were run, how many failed, and how many points you earned. Not all tests give the same amount of points when they are passed. Some tests are harder than others, and so you will earn more points by passing those!

Each method currently throws a `UnsupportedOperationException`. When you run the tests before you have removed the exception you will see a printout like this:
```
Running tests for NumberThree.
Total Tests: 7
Failures: 0
Successes: 0
NumberThree Score: 0
NumberThree Max Score: 15
```
Once you have removed the `throw new UnsupportedOperationException();` line and start implementing your method the tests will start running, and generate a score for your solution when you run the `ScoreCalculator` class. If you want to dig into which tests are passing or not for a challenge, you can use the run configurations set up for each challenge. Just select from the Run dropdown the tests for the challenge you are working on and run it!

The `ScoreCalculator` will also give you a total score. The output will contain the total possible points to earn, and also your current score.
```
Total Possible Points: 36
Your Total Score: 0
You got this! Keep it up!
```
We will be having a competition in class to see who can get the highest scores! Prizes will definitely be awarded!

All challenges are in the **src/main/java/challenges package.** Good luck!

Turning In The Project

Grading
-----
Your grade for each project will fall into one of four categories:

| Grade Level         | Explanation |
| :------------------ |:----------- |
| *Exceeds Expectations*        | <ul><li>Quality is outstanding. Extra credit and/or independent improvements apparent.</li><li>All errors have been found.</li></ul> |
| *Excellent*                   | <ul><li>Overall quality is high.</li><li>All errors have been found.</li></ul> |
| *Satisfactory*                | <ul><li>Overall quality is good.</li><li>Most errors have been found.</li><li>Improvements can be made to bring the quality up to <i>Excellent</i>.</li></ul> |
| *Needs Improvement*           | <ul><li>Overall quality is not yet high enough and the submission will not be accepted.</li><li>Improvements must be made to bring the quality up to at least <i>Satisfactory</i>.</li></ul> |
